# Word-Count-Tool-in-Python


here's a Python code for a Word Count Tool:

This code defines a function called word_count that takes in a file name as an argument. The function reads the contents of the file, splits the text into words using the split() method, and returns the length of the resulting list of words.

The program then prompts the user to enter the name of the file they want to count the words in, calls the word_count function with the file name as an argument, and prints the number of words in the file.
